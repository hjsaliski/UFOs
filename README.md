# UFOs

**Overview**

For this project we were using JavaScript to make create a website derived from UFO data and be able to sift and filter through that data based on multiple criteria. There were quite a few steps we needed to take before we reached the final project. We had to create the webpage using a standard javascript template and altered it to allow us to add photos and text boxes where we wanted specific information to go. We then had to import and format the UFO information to fit into the charts and boxes and be organized by specific columns. We then had to add specific filtering tools that will allow us to grab information based on certain criteria that the UFO data contained. After all of this we were able to make a functionally working website that allows us to filter UFO data from a set list of filter categories.

**Results**

After putting together all of the data into a javascript file and altering an html file we were able to create a website that showed and arranged the UFO data into a nice neat display with photos and different style headers.

During this challenge we were to also add a few more filtering techniques that will allow for further sifting when looking for a specific UFO sighting depending on date, city, state, country and shape.

**Summary**

One drawback to this design might be that it is very specific to just this type of information. This UFO information is given to us and is now made into a table which can be very long and cumbersome especially if the file is incredibly large and has to download it all at once. Two suggestions we could take in to make this better would be to add pages to this new website so that the data could be more easily accessible. Another suggestions would be that the filtering process could take in more filters or we could even make more specific filters that grabbed more than one data point at once.
